I will do the release of Perl 5.27.9 - a developer release of the programming language [Perl](http://perl.org) - on February 20th, 2018.
Fortunately the Perl5Porters have a long [checklist for the release manager](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/perl/Porting/release_managers_guide.pod). In this git repository you'll find the checklist for my release. There's even a small website for this:

[http://5-27-9.perl-services.de](http://5-27-9.perl-services.de).
